Hello! 
We are Team On The Way (OTW) from the Philippine Robotics Programming Guild (RPGP) consists of three dedicated and passionate members: Gab Flores, Lehman Lanzuela, and Jonluke Llorente.

The team was formed through a common passion for robotics, programming, and problem-solving. As active members of RPGP, we have always put ourselves in scenarios that challenge our skills and teamwork ability. Each one of us possesses his or her own strengths-embedded systems, mechanical design, algorithm development, and strategic planning.

Together, we want to innovate through teamwork, precision, and creativity. Be it with autonomous systems, working on robotics for tackling real-life problems, or going for national and international competitions-we're always on the way toward excellence and impact. 

We look forward to representing our organization with the commitment, creativity, and passion to help build the growing robotics community.
